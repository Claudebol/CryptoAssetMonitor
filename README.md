# CryptoAssetMonitor
Personal project. 
A Google Chrome extension that allows you to enter your balance for a specific cryptocurrency and keeps track of the price using CryptoCompare.com's data. 

To get started:
1. Go to this link and install the extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crypto-asset-monitor/iebmplnmdafcdjkkdommoboiajljbjog
   It is currently only available through this link.
2. Login or sign up.
3. To add an asset: 
   Click the green plus button at the bottom.
   Start typing the symbol or name of the coin to add.
   Select the coin from the suggestion list.
   Enter your balance for that coin.
   Click submit.
4. To remove an asset:
   Hover over the asset to remove.
   Click the red minus between the icon and balance.
   The asset will no longer be shown.
5. To adjust a balance:
   Click on the balance to be adjusted.
   Change the value, while keeping the cursor on that balance.
   When complete, move the cursor away from that coin.
   The balance is now adjusted.
